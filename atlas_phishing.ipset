# [ATLAS Phishing] (https://atlas.arbor.net/summary/fastflux) 
# - Phishing servers host content that is designed to 
# socially engineer unsuspecting users into surrendering 
# private information used for identity theft. These servers 
# are installed on compromised web servers or botnets, at 
# times. Phishing Web sites mimic legitimate Web sites, often 
# of a financial institution, in order to steal logins, 
# passwords, and personal information. Attackers trick users 
# into using the fake Web site by sending the intended victim 
# an e-mail claiming to be a legitimate institution 
# requesting the information for valid reasons, such as 
# account verification. They may then use the stolen 
# credentials to withdraw large amounts of money from the 
# victim's account or commit other fraudulent acts. Most 
# targeted brands are usually in the financial sector, 
# including banks and online commerce sites.
